The following question was asked by James Surowiecki on Twitter (May 23, 2021), "In the Heat/Bucks game yesterday, the Heat had more 3-point attempts than 2-point attempts *and* shot better from 3-point range (20-50) than they did from 2-point range (16-49). How often does that happen in a given season?"

The answer is not often but more frequently in the 2020 (9 times) and 2021 seasons (11 times). From 2008 to 2019, this happened a combined 6 times.
