The following question was asked on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the Heat/Bucks game yesterday, the Heat had more 3-point attempts than 2-point attempts *and* shot better from 3-point range (20-50) than they did from 2-point range (16-49). How often does that happen in a given season?</p>&mdash; James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1396422342214131712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2021</a></blockquote> 

The answer is not often but more frequently in the 2020 (9 times) and 2021 seasons (11 times). From 2008 to 2019, this happened a combined 6 times.

The below table answers the first part of this question.
